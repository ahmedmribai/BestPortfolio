Struggling to find an easy, free, and beautiful way to visualize different interior design styles, I decided to build RoomAI — the tool I wish existed.

Most AI interior design platforms are either clunky, expensive, or limit your usage. RoomAI changes that. It lets anyone upload a photo of their room, pick from multiple styles, and instantly transform their space with AI — all for free and with no design experience required.

From handling image uploads and integrating AI models to deploying a seamless frontend, I built the entire app end to end using modern technologies like React, Vercel, Replicate, and Bytescale. By the end, I had a fully functional product that blends design, AI, and user experience — and is live on the internet.
