Most traders lose track of their performance by relying on messy spreadsheets or scattered notes. This leads to repeated mistakes, emotional trading, and missed opportunities for growth.

To solve this real-world problem, I built Trading Journal, a modern, responsive web app designed to help traders log, analyze, and optimize their trades in one place. The platform provides clean data visualization, performance tracking, and strategy insights â€” empowering traders to make data-driven decisions and continuously improve their edge.
