I developed a SaaS Business Analytics Dashboard using React, Node.js, and Recharts. It allows companies to track sales, customers, and website performance in real time. Features include role-based authentication, customer management, sales tracking, and a professional dashboard UI with responsive charts. Stripe subscription integration makes it ready to monetize as a SaaS product.
