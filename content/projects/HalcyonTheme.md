I developed a full-stack e-commerce web app using React, Node.js, and Stripe. It includes user authentication, product management, a secure checkout flow, and an admin dashboard with sales analytics. Built with modern tools like TailwindCSS, Redux Toolkit, and MongoDB, the app is fully responsive and optimized for scalability.
